Hello! My name is David J. Gilhooley.
I am a systems programmer with a focus on operating systems.
I graduated Princeton University in 2017 with a Major in
Electrical Engineering and a Minor in Computer Science.

In my spare time I go hiking, go surfing, and go surfing.
I read a lot of Science Fiction in my spare time.
You can find me programming in a cafe with a strong cup of coffee.
