# Education

I graduated **Princeton University** with a degree in **Electrical Engineering**, a concentration in **Computer Architecture**  and a certificate in **Computer Science.**
I graduated with Highest Honors and as a member of Sigma Xi, the Research Honor Society.

My senior thesis was titled "Secure Boot: Formal Verification of Firmware and Hardware in a large SoC".
This thesis focused on using Formal Verification methods on C code that crosses the Hardware/Firmware boundary.
These methods were used to verify properties within Google's Chrome OS, using the code that interacted with the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and the SHA Accelerator.
This thesis won **Best Thesis in the Field of Computing** for Princeton's 2017 Class of Electrical Engineers.
